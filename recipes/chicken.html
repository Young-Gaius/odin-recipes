     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the chili powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic, ginger, salt, black pepper, cumin, coriander, turmeric, onion powder, tomato paste, and lemon juice to create a marinade.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and coat them thoroughly. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes, or refrigerate it overnight for more intense flavors.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill, stovetop pan, or oven to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>If grilling, preheat the grill and lightly oil the grates. Place the marinated chicken onto the grill and cook for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and has reached an internal temperature of 165Â°F (74Â°C).</li>
        <li>If using a stovetop pan, heat a bit of cooking oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook for about 4-6 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>If using an oven, preheat it to 400Â°F (200Â°C). Place the marinated chicken on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or foil. Bake for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the chicken from the heat source and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
     </ol>
     
     <p>Serve the spicy chicken hot with your choice of side dishes, such as steamed rice, naan bread, or a refreshing salad.ðŸ˜‹</p>
